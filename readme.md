# Ludum Dare 50

## Theme: Delay the inevitable

You are a yellow ball.
Your goal is to survive for as long as possible and make a dam to stop the flood.
You control the player with W, A, S, D.
To build the dam you need trees and to get them, you build up speed and roll into the tree.
The player pushes the trees to the dam to make it larger.

This is a combination of:
* Delay the inevitable
* One tool may purposes
* Single resource
* Momentum
